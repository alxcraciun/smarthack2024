### How to import the CSVs

- Place them in root in folder `/data/` 
- After this, make sure you have all CSVs correctly named:
  - `connections.csv`
  - `customers.csv`
  - `demands.csv`
  - `refineries.csv`
  - `tanks.csv`
- Optionally, you can store API keys inside `teams.csv`
- The `.gitignore` has the `/data/` folder already included so it won't be commited
